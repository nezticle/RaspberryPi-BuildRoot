	  system.

config BR2_CCACHE
	bool "Enable compiler cache"
	help
	  This option will enable the use of ccache, a compiler
	  cache. It will cache the result of previous builds to speed
	  up future builds. The cache is stored in
	  $HOME/.buildroot-ccache.

	  Note that Buildroot does not try to invalidate the cache
	  contents when the compiler changes in an incompatible
	  way. Therefore, if you make a change to the compiler version
	  and/or configuration, you are responsible for purging the
	  ccache cache by removing the $HOME/.buildroot-ccache
	  directory.

config BR2_CCACHE_DIR
	string "Compiler cache location"
	depends on BR2_CCACHE
	default "$(HOME)/.buildroot-ccache"
	help
	  Where ccache should store cached files.

	help
	  This option hides outdated/obsolete versions of packages.

config BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG
	bool "build packages with debugging symbols"
	help
	  Build packages with debugging symbols enabled. All libraries
	  and binaries in the 'staging' directory will have debugging
	  symbols, which allows remote debugging even if libraries and
	  binaries are stripped on the target. Whether libraries and
	  binaries are stripped on the target is controlled by the
	  BR2_STRIP_* options below.

if BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG
choice
	prompt "gcc debug level"
	default BR2_DEBUG_2
	help
	  Set the debug level for gcc

config BR2_DEBUG_1
	bool "debug level 1"
	help
	  Debug level 1 produces minimal information, enough
	  for making backtraces in parts of the program that
	  you don't plan to debug. This includes descriptions
	  of functions and external variables, but no information
	  about local variables and no line numbers.

config BR2_DEBUG_2
	bool "debug level 2"
	help
	  The default gcc debug level is 2

config BR2_DEBUG_3
	bool "debug level 3"
	help
	  Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the
	  macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers
	  support macro expansion when you use -g3.

choice

config BR2_STRIP_strip
	bool "strip"
	depends on !BR2_ELF2FLT
	help
	  Binaries and libraries in the target filesystem will be
	  stripped using the normal 'strip' command. This allows to
	  save space, mainly by removing debugging symbols. Debugging
	  symbols on the target are needed for native debugging, but
	  not when remote debugging is used.

config BR2_STRIP_sstrip
	bool "sstrip"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_SSTRIP_HOST
	depends on !BR2_ELF2FLT
	help
	  Binaries and libraries in the target filesystem will be
	  stripped using the 'sstrip' command, which strips a little
	  bit more than the traditional 'strip' command. This allows to
	  save space, mainly by removing debugging symbols. Debugging
	  symbols on the target are needed for native debugging, but
	  not when remote debugging is used.

config BR2_STRIP_none
	bool "none"
	help
	  Do not strip binaries and libraries in the target
	  filesystem.

config BR2_STRIP_EXCLUDE_FILES
	string "executables that should not be stripped"

	  here that should not be stripped on the target.

config BR2_STRIP_EXCLUDE_DIRS
	string "directories that should be skipped when stripping"
	depends on !BR2_STRIP_none
	default ""
	help
	  You may specify a space-separated list of directories that should
	  be skipped when stripping. Binaries and libraries in these
	  directories will not be touched.
	  The directories should be specified relative to the target directory,
	  without leading slash.

choice
	prompt "gcc optimization level"
	default BR2_OPTIMIZE_S
	help
	  Set the optimization level for gcc

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_0
	bool "optimization level 0"
	help
	  Do not optimize. This is the default.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_1
	bool "optimization level 1"
	help
	  Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time,
	  and a lot more memory for a large function. With -O, the
	  compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time,
	  without performing any optimizations that take a great deal
	  of compilation time. -O turns on the following optimization
	  flags: -fdefer-pop -fdelayed-branch -fguess-branch-probability
	  -fcprop-registers -floop-optimize -fif-conversion
	  -fif-conversion2 -ftree-ccp -ftree-dce -ftree-dominator-opts
	  -ftree-dse -ftree-ter -ftree-lrs -ftree-sra -ftree-copyrename
	  -ftree-fre -ftree-ch -funit-at-a-time -fmerge-constants
	  -O also turns on -fomit-frame-pointer on machines where doing
	  so does not interfere with debugging.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_2
	bool "optimization level 2"
	help
	  Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
	  that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. The compiler does not
	  perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify -O2.
	  As compared to -O, this option increases both compilation time and
	  the performance of the generated code. -O2 turns on all optimization
	  flags specified by -O. It also turns on the following optimization
	  flags: -fthread-jumps -fcrossjumping -foptimize-sibling-calls
	  -fcse-follow-jumps -fcse-skip-blocks -fgcse  -fgcse-lm
	  -fexpensive-optimizations -fstrength-reduce -frerun-cse-after-loop
	  -frerun-loop-opt -fcaller-saves -fpeephole2 -fschedule-insns
	  -fschedule-insns2 -fsched-interblock -fsched-spec -fregmove
	  -fstrict-aliasing -fdelete-null-pointer-checks -freorder-blocks
	  -freorder-functions -falign-functions -falign-jumps -falign-loops
	  -falign-labels -ftree-vrp -ftree-pre
	  Please note the warning under -fgcse about invoking -O2 on programs
	  that use computed gotos.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_3
	bool "optimization level 3"
	help
	  Optimize yet more. -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2
	  and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops and
	  -fgcse-after-reload options.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_S
	bool "optimize for size"
	help
	  Optimize for size. -Os enables all -O2 optimizations that do not
	  typically increase code size. It also performs further optimizations
	  designed to reduce code size. -Os disables the following optimization
	  flags: -falign-functions -falign-jumps -falign-loops -falign-labels
	  -freorder-blocks -freorder-blocks-and-partition -fprefetch-loop-arrays
	  -ftree-vect-loop-version

endchoice

config BR2_PREFER_STATIC_LIB
	bool "prefer static libraries"
	help
	  Where possible, build and use static libraries for the target.
	  This potentially increases your code size and should only be
	  used if you know what you do.
	  The default is to build dynamic libraries and use those on
	  the target filesystem.

	  WARNING: This is highly experimental at the moment.

config BR2_HAVE_DOCUMENTATION
	bool "documentation on the target"
	help
	  Install the documentation, including manual pages and info
	  pages, on the target.
	  If you say n here, your target will not contain any
	  documentation.

config BR2_HAVE_DEVFILES
	bool "development files in target filesystem"
	help
	  Install headers and static libraries in the
	  target filesystem

config BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE
	string "location of a package override file"
	default "$(TOPDIR)/local.mk"
	help
	  A package override file is a short makefile that contains
	  variable definitions of the form <pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR,
	  which allows to tell Buildroot to use an existing directory
	  as the source directory for a particular package. See the
	  Buildroot documentation for more details on this feature.
